###Project Overview

I will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host my web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

###Why this Project?

A deep understanding of exactly what my web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define me as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, I’ll be responsible for turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host my applications need.

###What will I Learn?

I will learn how to access, secure, and perform the initial configuration of a bare-bones Linux server. I will then learn how to install and configure a web and database server and actually host a web application.

###How does this Help my Career?

Deploying my web applications to a publicly accessible server is the first step in getting users
Properly securing my application ensures my application remains stable and that my user’s data is safe
